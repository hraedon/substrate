# Session Reflection — 2026-05-17

**Work summary:** Ran a full adversarial reviewer + security expert evaluation of the substrate codebase. No critical vulnerabilities found. Nine new breadcrumbs (BC-172–180) opened covering the actionable findings: two medium (rfc8785 SPOF and TLS/postgres + plaintext key files), seven low (operational/config issues).

## On the project

Substrate is unusually well-built for a pre-1.0 library. The architectural discipline — `_contract.py` as shared business logic, `EventStore` protocol, `SELECT FOR UPDATE` on every mutation path, gap-free seq allocation, and 100% parameterized SQL — is the kind of thing you expect from a senior team's second or third iteration, not a greenfield project. The breadcrumb system (170+ entries) shows the project has been systematically hardened.

The security model is appropriate for the intended deployment (single-operator homelab). The trust-tier classification (§17.9: authenticated/server-stamped/actor-claimed) is well-defined and consistently applied. The opt-in role enforcement (BC-049, BC-101) is the most controversial design tradeoff — it's documented and deliberate, but it will surprise operators who assume "allowed_roles: [admin]" means enforcement by default.

## On the work done

The audit was thorough — I tracked every SQL query, every concurrency path, every input boundary. The deep-dive agent returned an exceptionally detailed report that gave me confidence in both the positive and negative findings. The JCS test suite (`tests/test_jcs.py`) is particularly impressive — 131 lines covering Unicode normalization edge cases, float boundaries, and integer domain safety.

The nine new breadcrumbs are all genuine findings. Nothing was inflated. The two medium-severity ones (BC-172, BC-180) are supply-chain/deployment hardening items, not code bugs. The low-severity ones are mostly sidecar operational hardening (docs exposure, body size limits, middleware scope) that matter more in multi-tenant deployments than homelab.

I chose not to open BCs for issues already tracked: self-attested roles (BC-101), no rate limiting (BC-102), HMAC in-memory (BC-100), opt-in enforcement (BC-049), and payload idempotency (BC-004).

## On what remains

**Before this could be used in a multi-tenant or higher-trust deployment:**

1. BC-172 (rfc8785 SPOF) — adding a cross-validation canonicalization path would meaningfully reduce the blast radius of a library bug.
2. BC-173 (TLS enforcement) + BC-180 (encrypted keys) — operators connecting over untrusted networks need these.
3. BC-174 (key status warnings) — one-line fix, should be done soon.
4. BC-175 (docs exposure) — add a config flag to disable Swagger in production.
5. BC-178 (body size guard in sidecar) — simple loop counter, low effort.

**Quality improvements:**

6. BC-177 (actor_id length) — defensive, cheap to add.
7. BC-176 (middleware method check) — future-proofing, one-line change.
8. BC-179 (dead-letter atomicity) — theoretical, could accept as-is with a doc note.

## Gaps to flag

- **`sidecar/app.py:28-30`**: The `sole_signer_middleware` reassembles the body from `request.stream()` with no size guard. Combined with no rate limiting (BC-102), this is a memory exhaustion path. A 10GB POST would OOM the sidecar before any validation kicks in.
- **`_hooks.py:288-289`**: The `with conn.transaction()` wrapping handler execution inside `poll_and_process_hooks` creates a nested savepoint since `poll_and_process_hooks` is already called within an outer transaction. BC-065 acknowledged this as low probability, but it's an implicit coupling between the caller's transaction management and the handler's expectations.
- **`_keys.py:60-61`**: `continue` on unknown status is the most "silent failure" pattern in the codebase. No log, no metric, no error. If an operator makes a YAML typo in the key file, their only signal is "key count is one lower than expected" in the startup log.
- **No conformance test for TLS status check**: If BC-173 is implemented, the property-based conformance tests in `tests/test_property_conformance.py` should verify that the InMemory and Postgres backends handle the `require_ssl` flag consistently (even if InMemory always passes).
