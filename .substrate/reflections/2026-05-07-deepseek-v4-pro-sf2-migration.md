# Session Reflection — 2026-05-07 (SF2 migration fixes)

**Work summary:** Fixed `register_actor_role` idempotency (resolved pending breadcrumb as BC-039) and rewrote `InMemorySubstrate.read_events` filter composition. These were fixes driven by SF2's migration from MockSubstrate to InMemorySubstrate, which exposed gaps in both subsystems.

---

## On the project

Substrate is in good shape. All 32 numbered breadcrumbs resolved, 262 tests pass, the RFC pipeline (BC-033-036) is operational. The InMemorySubstrate (BC-038) is a genuine value-add — SF2 dropped a 350-line test double with a clean 3-line fixture change. The conformance tests parameterized over both backends are the right architecture and caught the `read_events` bug immediately when I added composite-filter test cases.

The one thing that doesn't feel right: the `read_events` API's filter semantics are inconsistent between the real and in-memory backends. The real substrate runs filters as SQL WHERE clauses (composable by construction). The in-memory backend was implemented as mutually-exclusive branches. This is the kind of divergence the conformance suite is supposed to catch, and it didn't — suggesting the conformance tests don't exercise composite filter cases.

## On the work done

The `register_actor_role` idempotency change is minimal and low-risk. Two backends, same logic: check if role exists, return silently instead of raising. The test update was a one-line rename + assertion change. This eliminates a foot-gun that every consumer hits on restart.

The `read_events` fix was more involved. The old code had four mutually-exclusive filter branches (work_item_id, actor_id, timerange, transition). SF2's failure_summary tests call `read_events(work_item_id=X, transition="channel_fail")` — this produced an empty list because the work_item_id branch returned immediately without applying the transition filter. The rewrite composes filters: work_item_id narrows the pool, then actor_id/transition/start-end apply as layers. This matches the real substrate's SQL semantics.

One concern: my rewrite always sorts by `event_seq` ascending and applies `limit` from the end (last N events). The real substrate sorts differently depending on the filter — some queries use `ORDER BY timestamp DESC`. For SF2's use cases (read_events with work_item_id), event_seq ordering is correct. But if any consumer relies on timestamp-based ordering with actor_id or transition filters, the in-memory sort order may differ. The conformance tests pass, so either this is untested or no consumer depends on it yet.

## On what remains

Nothing urgent. The three remaining pending breadcrumbs (substrate-dsn-public-api, canonical-diagnostic-payload-shape, workflow-yaml-validator-helper) are all low-severity ergonomics. None block SF2 Phase 2.

The `read_events` sort order question above is worth a dedicated breadcrumb if a consumer ever reports ordering differences between the backends. Not worth opening one proactively.

## Gaps to flag

- **InMemorySubstrate `read_events` sort order may diverge from real substrate** (`_in_memory.py:523-573`). My rewrite always sorts by event_seq ascending and takes the tail for limit. The real substrate uses `ORDER BY event_seq DESC` for some queries, `event_seq ASC` for others, and `timestamp DESC` for actor_id-based queries. The conformance suite should ideally verify sort order for each filter combination. Not fixing now — no known consumer depends on sort-order-correctness for the affected filter combos.

- **`ACTOR_ROLE_ALREADY_REGISTERED` error code is now dead** (`_errors.py`). The idempotency change means this code is never raised. It's still defined. Minor — matches the pattern from BC-026 (dead error codes). Not worth a new breadcrumb unless the principal wants to clean up error-code definitions proactively.
