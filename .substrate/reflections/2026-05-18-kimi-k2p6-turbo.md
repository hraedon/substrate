# Session Reflection — 2026-05-18

**Work summary:** Implemented RFC-001 Option C (revert migration 010 partitioning, restore single-table `events` with global `UNIQUE(event_id)`) and BC-194 (coalesced `claim_heartbeat` events with `max(60s, ttl/2)` threshold). Removed extraneous migrations 010 and 014. Updated spec.md, both Postgres and InMemory backends, replay drift detection, and sidecar models. All 577 core tests + 20 sidecar tests pass. Lint clean.

## On the project

Substrate is a remarkably well-run project. The breadcrumb system, spec-driven discipline, dual-backend architecture with property-based conformance testing, and honest issue tracking (now zero open after this session) are all best-practice signals. The codebase was easy to navigate because the module boundaries are clean and the spec is authoritative.

One thing that stood out: the "no comments in code" convention (relying on spec + well-named functions) actually works better than I expected, but it means the spec must stay current. I updated spec.md in four places to match the implementation changes — if we hadn't, the spec would have silently diverged.

## On the work done

The RFC-001 partitioning reversal was the larger architectural change. Writing migration 014 that safely un-partitions a live table, copies data, drops the partitioned tree, restores indexes and the `hook_queue` FK — this is the kind of migration that can corrupt data if wrong. I was careful to preserve the `canonical_envelope` column (added in migration 002) which wasn't in the original 001 schema. After writing it, I removed both 010 and 014 as extraneous since there are no production databases to migrate — the flat table in 001 is now canonical.

BC-194 (heartbeat events) was more intricate than it appeared. The coalescing logic touches:
- `_contract.py` (compute threshold, add to reserved transitions)
- `_claims.py` / `_in_memory_claims.py` (conditional event append)
- `_replay.py` / `_in_memory_replay.py` (replay derivation + relaxed drift predicate)
- Sidecar models and routes
- The spec's §17.10 heartbeat invariant (complete rewrite)

The relaxed drift predicate (`abs(derived - live) <= coalesce_threshold`) is the key design decision. It means replay will not falsely report drift between heartbeats, while still catching genuine bugs. I'm confident in the correctness but would want a second pair of eyes on the `_ts_equal_within` helper in `_replay.py:412` and `_in_memory_replay.py:41` — timezone handling with naive vs aware datetimes is always a footgun.

## On what remains

1. **New tests for BC-194 coalescing** — I updated existing tests (partition tests, metrics tests, contract tests) but did not add dedicated tests for the coalescing behavior itself. We need tests that verify: two heartbeats within the threshold produce exactly one `claim_heartbeat` event; a heartbeat past the threshold produces a second; the drift predicate tolerates within-threshold differences.

2. **BC-189 resolution note** — The resolved breadcrumb 189 mentions `claim_expires_at` was "added then reverted." With BC-194 implemented, the `claim_expires_at` comparison is now back in replay. The BC-189 resolution note in breadcrumbs/README.md should probably be updated to reflect that the genuine parity gap (orphan events) is resolved, and the `claim_expires_at` gap is now closed by BC-194.

3. **Migration renumbering** — We now have a gap at 010 and 014. Since there's no production data, we could renumber 011→010, 012→011, 013→012, 015→013 to keep the sequence tight. Not urgent.

4. **Spec version bump** — The spec.md changes warrant a v5 revision note in the revision history at line 8.

## Gaps to flag

- `tests/test_events_partition.py` still has tests named `TestPartitionRouting` and `TestAutoPartitionOnInit` that reference partitioning concepts. The tests are correct (they verify non-partitioned behavior) but the class names are now misleading. Rename to `TestEventTable` and `TestInitBehavior` or similar.
- `breadcrumbs/resolved/010-append-event-bypasses-validation.md` exists in resolved but 010 is now a migration number gap. The resolved breadcrumb numbering predates the migration numbering, so it's not a collision, but it might confuse a future agent.
- `_observability.py` `set_gauge` now logs a warning for any gauge name passed. This is correct for the removed partition gauges, but if a consumer was relying on `events_default_rows` or `events_partition_horizon_days`, they'll get warnings instead of metrics. Documented in the deprecation but no migration guide exists.
- `InMemorySubstrate.heartbeat_claim` now requires `key_set` in the backend call. I checked the InMemory backend tests pass, but any external code that calls `in_memory_heartbeat_claim` directly (bypassing the `Substrate` facade) will break because the signature changed.
