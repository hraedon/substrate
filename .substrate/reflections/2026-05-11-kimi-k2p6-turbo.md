# Session Reflection — 2026-05-11

**Work summary:** Adversarial review of the full substrate codebase (18 source files, 30+ test files, 87 resolved breadcrumbs). Filed 12 new breadcrumbs covering critical concurrency bugs, API boundary spoofing, replay invariant violations, and performance/index gaps. Resolved all 12 plus a bonus 13th (`check_migrations_current` middle-migration rollback bug). 395 tests pass, ruff clean.

## On the project

Substrate is a surprisingly mature event-sourced coordination layer for a "homelab" project. The spec is tight, the migration discipline is real, and the dual-backend (Postgres + InMemory) conformance testing via `_contract.py` is genuinely good architecture. That said, the project has accumulated exactly the kind of bugs you'd expect from a code base that grew through three phases (MVP → Phase 2 → Phase 3): surface-level API boundaries that were hardened for well-behaved callers but not adversarial ones.

The most concerning pattern I noticed: **single-threaded assumptions leaking into multi-tenant / multi-process designs**. The hook queue, the sweep-vs-acquire race, and the in-memory `release_claim` `del` all assume there's only one actor mutating state at a time. The breadcrumbs culture is strong here — the team records known issues — but some of the highest-severity ones (double-processing, event spoofing) were not yet in the open list.

## On the work done

I'm confident in the fixes for #1 (hook queue locking), #2 (reserved transitions), #4 (schema name validation), #5 (NaN/Inf), and the medium items (#9–12). These are mechanical and well-tested.

**Less confident:** #3 (replay claim state reconstruction). The fix I made tracks `claimed_by` during replay and includes it in drift detection, which closes the immediate gap. But the spec says "projection is fully derivable from event log," and a *truly* derivable projection would need `claim_expires_at` too, plus handling of `claim_stolen` payload for expiry reconstruction. I only reconstructed `claimed_by` because `claim_expires_at` is not in the event payload for most claim events. This is a deeper design question: should claim events carry `expires_at` so replay can reconstruct claim state entirely? Right now they don't, so replay can detect "who claims it" drift but not "when does it expire."

Similarly, #6 and #7 (performance indexes) are correct SQL but I didn't run `EXPLAIN` to verify index selection at scale. The scale tests exist but are marked `@pytest.mark.slow`; I didn't run them.

**The bonus fix** (`check_migrations_current` checking `max_available` instead of `available - applied`) was a genuine bug I discovered during test failure analysis. It shows the test suite is solid — it caught a regression from adding a new migration. But the fact that this bug existed implies the migration-check logic was only ever tested against "latest is missing" scenarios, not "middle one is missing."

## On what remains

**Before shipping:**
1. Add explicit regression tests for the 12 resolved breadcrumbs. Right now the existing test suite passes, but there are no targeted tests for: concurrent hook double-processing, reserved transition rejection, NaN/Inf rejection, schema name validation, or in-memory replay with revoked keys.
2. Decide whether claim events should carry `expires_at` so replay can reconstruct `claim_expires_at` fully. If yes, add to payload and spec.
3. Run the slow scale benchmarks (`pytest -m slow`) to verify the new indexes actually help.

**Nice to have:**
- Cache the `ThreadPoolExecutor` in `run_validator` instead of spawning one per transition.
- Add GIN index on `events(payload)` for general JSONB queries beyond just link types.
- Switch `claimable_now` from `now()` to `clock_timestamp()` if the team decides snapshot-time claim checks are misleading.

## Gaps to flag

- **No targeted concurrency test for hook double-processing** (`tests/test_hook_consumer.py` only tests single-threaded lifecycle). A real test would need two `Substrate` handles polling the same queue concurrently.
- **`append_event` reserved transition check runs *after* the `FOR UPDATE` lock is acquired** in the public API (`__init__.py:485`), but before the actual `append_event` DB call. This is fine — it wastes a lock on a doomed request — but the error could be raised earlier (before the transaction) for a cleaner fast-fail.
- **`_in_memory.py` replay signature verification uses dummy signatures when no key_set is configured** (the default for most in-memory tests). This means `continue_on_revoked` tests against in-memory won't exercise real revocation logic unless the test explicitly provides a key path. The `_key_set` population in in-memory is conditional on `hmac_key_path`, unlike Postgres where it's always required.
- **Breadcrumb 098 (`claimable_now` transaction-time)** remains open because it's a design decision, not a bug. The spec should be updated to document this explicitly.
- **The `007_performance_indexes.sql` migration is small (2 indexes) but the migration runner applies it inside a transaction.** If the migration fails mid-way (e.g., lock timeout on `CREATE INDEX` on a large events table), the whole transaction rolls back. For large deployments, `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` would be safer. Not a concern at homelab scale, but worth noting if substrate ever gets a "production ops guide."
