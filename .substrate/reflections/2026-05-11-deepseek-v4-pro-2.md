# Session Reflection — 2026-05-11

**Work summary:** Validated recent RFC-062 conformance work, fixed a backend-divergence
bug found by property-based tests (null-byte strings), then performed an adversarial
code review and resolved all actionable gaps — expanding JSONB-safe validation to cover
surrogates and all dict entry points, consolidating duplicated idempotency logic.
Deferred 6 non-critical observations as breadcrumbs 065–070.

## On the project

Substrate is in the "mature prototype" sweet spot — genuinely clean architecture, good
test coverage, a spec that's actually followed. The dual-backend design (Postgres +
InMemory) was a real maintenance tax before RFC-062, and the contract extraction is the
right fix. The property-based conformance tests are the star of the show — they found a
real divergence (null bytes) that a month of manual review missed.

Two structural impressions that linger after working in the codebase:

1. The JSONB/Python-dict impedance mismatch is the root cause of every remaining
conformance risk. Postgres JSONB is stricter than Python dicts (null bytes, surrogates,
numeric precision), and the contract layer can't see this divergence because it operates
on already-deserialized Python values. The fix in this session (validate at the entry
point before serialization) is correct but fragile — every new JSONB-bound field needs
to remember to call the validator. A `Jsonb()` wrapper that validates internally would
be more robust.

2. `__init__.py` at 1340 lines with individual re-export blocks is a minor readability
tax but tells a story: the library grew feature by feature without a second pass at API
surface organization. Not harmful, just a sign of steady accretion.

## On the work done

The adversarial review surface was well-bounded — the codebase is unusually clean, and
most observations were in the "polish" category. The one real finding (HIGH #1 +
MEDIUM #2 — incomplete JSONB-safe validation scope) was the right call to fix now,
before hypothesis tripped over surrogates next.

The consolidation of idempotency logic was satisfying — removing the duplicated
collision-check code in `_events.py` in favor of a single `_contract.py` call is
exactly the spirit of RFC-062. The dead `payload` parameter was a textbook example of
signature drift.

What went well: the `validate_json_safe_value` design (recursive deep-walk covering
strings in dicts, lists, and keys) is clean and catches the whole class of JSONB-unsafe
characters in one pass. Integration at all entry points was mechanical — the entry
points are well-isolated.

What I'd want second eyes on: the surrogate range (`0xD800`–`0xDFFF`). The check
correctly rejects unpaired surrogates, but Python 3.12 allows legitimate surrogate pairs
in strings. RFC 8259 (JSON) allows escaped surrogate pairs but forbids raw/lone
surrogates. The current check rejects ALL characters in that range, which is
conservative but correct for JSONB safety.

## On what remains

Nothing critical. The project is ship-shape. The deferred breadcrumbs (065–070) are
all polish/design-note items — none block correctness or usability.

Worth doing before any public release:
- Breadcrumb 067: dedicated `tests/test_contract.py` unit tests. The 21 pure functions
  are tested implicitly, but explicit edge-case coverage for `resolve_claim_acquire`
  TTL boundaries and `validate_json_safe_value` edge cases would increase confidence.

Nice to have:
- Breadcrumb 069: collapse the `__init__.py` re-export boilerplate
- Breadcrumb 068: unify the `validate_field_values`/`validate_field_update` param types
- Run `test_property_conformance` with `max_examples=1000` overnight to stress-test

## Gaps to flag

- `src/substrate/_events.py:118-123`: The `validate_json_safe_value` import is inside
  the function body (lazy import pattern). This matches the existing style in this file
  (e.g. `_claims.py:39`, `_hooks.py:143`) but is inconsistent with module-level imports
  in `_in_memory.py`. Pick one convention.
- `src/substrate/_contract.py:343`: `validate_json_safe_value` walks dicts and lists
  but does not handle `bytes`, `set`, or custom objects — these would pass through
  silently. In practice, only `dict`/`list`/`str`/`int`/`float`/`bool`/`None` reach
  JSONB, so the gap is theoretical.
- `src/substrate/_events.py:60-67`: The Postgres `check_idempotency` now delegates to
  `_contract.py::check_idempotency`, but the contract version checks `actor_id is not
  None` before comparing — the old code checked `actor_id is not None` too, but the
  `Event.actor_id` field is always a `str`, never `None`. The `is not None` guard is
  belt-and-suspenders; fine.
- `tests/test_property_conformance.py:51`: Hypothesis `st.text()` can generate zero-width
  joiners, bidirectional markers, and other Unicode edge cases. None of these should
  crash JSONB, but they could produce interesting conformance diffs.
