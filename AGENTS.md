# Substrate — Agent Guide

## Project Overview

Substrate is a Python library providing coordination and durable state for agent pipelines over Postgres. It implements an event-sourced model with a transactionally-consistent denormalized projection.

**Spec:** `spec.md` is authoritative. `spec.yaml` is a machine-readable sidecar. The spec is amendable when implementation reveals it cannot deliver a stated guarantee — see BC-008/FR-15 for precedent. Amendments are made deliberately, with a breadcrumb resolution note explaining the change; do not silently diverge from the spec.

## Architecture

### Isolation: Schema-per-project

One Postgres database, one schema per project. The `Substrate` handle owns one logical project namespace. Connection pool is shared; `SET LOCAL search_path` scopes each transaction.

### Core data model

- **Events** (`events` table): immutable append-only log. Gap-free `event_seq` per work-item, allocated under canonical row lock.
- **Projection** (`work_items_current`): denormalized, transactionally-consistent with events. Fully derivable from event log via replay.
- **Claims** (`claims` table): durable leases with TTL, attempt tracking, auto-steal on expiry.
- **Workflow registry** (`workflow_registry`): append-only, versioned workflow definitions. Work-items pin their version at creation.

### Key invariants

- Events are the authoritative source. `work_items_current` is a projection, never edited directly.
- Every mutation acquires `SELECT FOR UPDATE` on the work-item's row in `work_items_current`.
- Library is the sole signer (HMAC-SHA256 over RFC 8785 canonical JSON). API rejects pre-signed events.
- `synchronous_commit = on` on all connections.

## Public API (§19)

The `Substrate` class is the sole entry point. No Postgres internals leak across the boundary.

```python
from substrate import Substrate

# Create a new project
sub = Substrate.create_project(dsn, "my_project", hmac_key_path="/path/to/keys.json")

# Connect to existing
sub = Substrate(dsn, "my_project", hmac_key_path="/path/to/keys.json")

# Operations
sub.register_workflow(yaml_content)
sub.create_work_item(workflow_name, work_item_type, actor_id, ...)
sub.transition(work_item_id, transition_name, actor_id, ...)
sub.append_event(work_item_id, actor_id, *, transition=..., payload=...)
sub.acquire_claim(work_item_id, actor_id, ttl_seconds=300)
sub.heartbeat_claim(work_item_id, actor_id, ttl_seconds, *, expected_attempt_number=...)
sub.release_claim(work_item_id, actor_id)
sub.sweep_expired_claims()
sub.ensure_event_partitions(months_ahead=3)  # idempotent; call on a timer to keep ahead of `events_default`
sub.query_work_items(workflow_name=..., current_states=[...], claimable_now=True, custom_field_filters={...})
sub.read_events(work_item_id=...)
sub.create_link(from_id, to_id, link_type, actor_id, payload=...)
sub.remove_link(from_id, to_id, link_type, actor_id)
sub.replay()  # -> ReplayReport with drift detection
sub.replay(continue_on_revoked=True)  # skip revoked-key events with warnings
sub.close()

# Phase 2 — hooks, validators, escalation, lint
sub.register_validator(transition_name, fn)        # sync, 5s timeout, blocks transition on failure
sub.register_hook_handler(event_type, fn)          # async dispatch via hook_queue
sub.start_hook_consumer()                          # background thread: LISTEN + 30s poll
sub.stop_hook_consumer()
sub.poll_hooks()                                   # manual drain (in lieu of consumer thread)
sub.claim_hooks(max_batch, lease_seconds)          # lease a batch for out-of-process processing
sub.complete_hook(hook_queue_id)                   # ack success on a leased hook
sub.fail_hook(hook_queue_id, error)                # ack failure; requeues or dead-letters per max_retries
sub.sweep_expired_hook_leases()                    # requeue rows past their lease deadline
sub.list_dead_lettered_hooks()
sub.requeue_dead_lettered_hook(hook_id)
sub.validate_actor_metadata(metadata, schema=None)  # lint helper (FR-18)

# Phase 3 — actor role enforcement, replay resilience
sub.update_not_before(work_item_id, not_before, actor_id)  # reschedule work item
sub.register_actor_role(actor_id, role)              # register actor → role mapping
sub.unregister_actor_role(actor_id, role)            # remove actor → role mapping
sub.list_actor_roles(actor_id=None)                  # list registered roles

# Standalone utilities (no database required)
validate_yaml(yaml_string_or_path)                     # -> ValidationResult
compose_workflow(file_or_path)                         # -> composed dict + SourceMap (FR-29)
```

**API constraints:**
- `append_event` rejects transitions that match a workflow-defined transition name — use `transition()` for state changes
- `heartbeat_claim` accepts optional `expected_attempt_number` to detect stale sessions after claim theft
- Claim mutations (acquire, release, sweep) emit events for audit trail; heartbeats do not
- Escalation (FR-10) fires automatically inside `acquire_claim` when `attempt_number >= attempt_threshold`; sets `needs_review`, emits `escalated`, idempotent
- Hooks dead-letter after max retries and emit `hook_dead_lettered`; replay handles both `escalated` and `hook_dead_lettered`

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Schema-per-project** not DB-per-project. One pool, one backup target, engine-enforced isolation via `GRANT ON SCHEMA`. Migration path to `tenant_id`-in-shared-DB documented but not needed at homelab scale.
2. **Library, not daemon.** Runs in-process. No HTTP server. Exposes `prometheus_client.CollectorRegistry` for host app to mount.
3. **Hybrid persistence.** Events authoritative; projection updated in same transaction. Not pure event-sourcing (no per-read replay cost).
4. **Signing is internal.** RFC 8785 canonicalization + HMAC-SHA256 computed inside the library. Callers submit unsigned field tuples.

## Known constraints

- **Schema-per-project requires session-scoped `search_path`.** Substrate uses `SET LOCAL search_path` per transaction. This is incompatible with connection-pooling middleware that dispatches transactions across different backends (e.g., PgBouncer in transaction mode). Use PgBouncer in session mode, or connect directly to Postgres. Medium-term migration path: fully-qualified table names (BC-033).
- **`events` is partitioned by month on `timestamp` (migration 010).** Host process must call `sub.ensure_event_partitions()` on a timer (alongside `sweep_expired_claims`) or new months land in `events_default`. The `hook_queue.event_id → events.event_id` FK was dropped (partitioned tables cannot maintain it without including the partition key); a replay-time orphan check is tracked in BC-145. The partial unique index `idx_events_one_escalated` is enforced per-partition; cross-partition uniqueness for `(work_item_id, event_seq)` relies on seq allocation under the canonical row lock and is asserted at the application layer.

## Status

MVP + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Plans 002-004 implemented. All FRs FR-01 through FR-29 are in tree. 476 tests + 4 scale benchmarks passing.

Production readiness additions: migration packaging for pip installs (importlib.resources + force-include), claims_stolen metric wired, actor_kind validation at API boundary, docstrings on all public methods, spec.yaml synced to v4, structured replay error handling.

Phase 3 additions: FR-24 (actor → allowed_roles enforcement, closes BR-09), FR-25 (continue-on-revoked replay flag), FR-26 (update_not_before API), FR-27 (custom field validation at transition time). Migration `005_actor_roles.sql` adds the actor_roles table. ReplayReport gains `warnings` field.

Plans 002-004 additions:
- **Plan 002 (Admin CLI):** `substrate` console entry point (`src/substrate/_cli.py`). Commands: `workflow validate`, `work-item show/list`, `events show/tail`, `replay`, `schema init/status`, `hooks dead-letter list/requeue`, `actor-roles list`. No DB required for `workflow validate`. Integration tested but CLI integration tests not yet added.
- **Plan 003 (Recurring work-items, FR-28):** New `recurrence_rules` table (migration 012). Schedule kinds: `interval` and `rrule`. Public API on `Substrate` and `InMemorySubstrate`: `register_recurrence_rule`, `list_recurrence_rules`, `due_recurrences`, `fire_recurrence`, `cancel_recurrence_rule`, `update_recurrence_rule`. New error codes: `RECURRENCE_RULE_NOT_FOUND`, `RECURRENCE_RULE_EXHAUSTED`, `RECURRENCE_SCHEDULE_INVALID`, `RECURRENCE_TEMPLATE_INVALID`. Dependency: `python-dateutil`.
- **Plan 004 (Workflow composition, FR-29):** `_workflow_compose.py` with `resolve_includes`, `_deep_merge`, and `compose_workflow`. `extends:` field added to JSON Schema. `parse_file()` now resolves composition. Keyed list merge by `(name, from)` for transitions, `__append`/`__remove` list modifiers. New error code `WORKFLOW_COMPOSE_ERROR`.

RFC-062: Single-source-of-truth backend contract via `_contract.py` — 20 pure validation/decision functions shared by both Postgres and InMemory backends. Property-based conformance tests via hypothesis in `tests/test_property_conformance.py`.

BC-139: `query_work_items` accepts `custom_field_filters: dict[str, object] | None` for equality filtering on custom field values (AND semantics). Postgres uses JSONB containment (`@>`) with a GIN index. InMemory uses equivalent dict matching. Migration `009_custom_fields_gin.sql` adds the index. Unknown filter keys produce empty results, not errors.

## Conventions

- Python 3.11+, `from __future__ import annotations` in all files
- No comments in code (style rule). Rationale: `spec.md` and `AGENTS.md` are the canonical reference for behavior and intent. Code is expected to be self-explanatory through naming and structure. Comments drift as the spec evolves. Instead of comments, extract well-named helper functions, add test cases, or update the spec. Inline spec cross-references (e.g., `# AC-28`) are acceptable on non-obvious invariants.
- Frozen dataclasses for all domain types
- `dict_row` factory on all psycopg connections
- All mutations go through `mgr.transaction()` which sets `SET LOCAL search_path`
- Error codes are part of the API contract (§19.5)
- Tests reach internal state via `substrate._testing` only — never import `_mgr` directly

## Agent Workflow

This project tracks work outside the code. New agents should orient to these conventions before making changes.

### Breadcrumbs (`breadcrumbs/`)

Defects, design questions, and improvements live one-file-per-item under `breadcrumbs/`, with resolved items moved to `breadcrumbs/resolved/`. Schema and severity definitions are in `breadcrumbs/README.md`. Open the index before starting work — it's the canonical "what's known to be wrong" list.

When you notice an issue you're not fixing in this session, file a breadcrumb. When you fix one, move it to `resolved/` and update the README index. The `/end` skill automates both.

### Worklog (`.substrate/worklog.md`)

Reverse-chronological session log. Each entry: focus, context, what was delivered (with file references), breadcrumbs resolved, test/lint results. Read the most recent entry on session start; prepend a new entry on session end.

### Reflections (`.substrate/reflections/`)

Per-session subjective notes from the agent. Useful signal for the next agent — read the latest before starting. Written via the `/reflect` skill.

### Session commands

Substrate-specific wrappers in `.substrate/commands/`:
- `/start` — orient to current state (worklog tail, open breadcrumbs, git status)
- `/end` — run tests, reconcile breadcrumbs, update worklog, write reflection, commit
- `/reflection` — write a reflection only

System-wide skills (`/reflect`, `/end`) provide portable equivalents; the substrate-specific versions add test runs and worklog updates.

## Patterns

### Telemetry via hooks

Substrate's `actor_metadata` is JSONB — free-form structured metadata for downstream consumers. To produce indexed aggregates (e.g., per-role pass rates), register a hook handler on the relevant event types that writes denormalized rows to a consumer-maintained reporting table. The reporting table lives outside substrate's schema; substrate's contract is the authoritative event log, and the reporting table is a derived view that can be rebuilt by replaying events through the same handler.

A complete, runnable minimal example is in `examples/telemetry_via_hooks.py`.

Recommended shape:

1. **Reporting table** in a separate schema (or external store) with indexed columns for the dimensions you query by.
2. **Hook handler** that reads `actor_metadata`, extracts dimensions, and upserts the reporting row.
3. **Rebuild path**: drain the events table through the same handler in `event_seq` order to reconstruct from scratch.

Do not add denormalized columns to substrate's `events` table for consumer-specific dimensions. Substrate stays general; the consumer maintains its own reporting layer.

### Diagnostic payload shape

Transition events carrying failure information should use this canonical shape for `payload`:

```python
payload = {
    "diagnostics": {
        "kind": str,           # consumer-defined enum value (e.g. "gate_fail", "channel_fail")
        "summary": str,        # one-line human-readable
        "messages": list[str], # detailed lines
        "context": dict,       # consumer-specific structured data
    }
}
```

Each consumer extends `kind` and `context` for its domain. This shape is not code-enforced, but using it prevents fragmentation across consumers and ensures telemetry tooling can aggregate failures uniformly.
