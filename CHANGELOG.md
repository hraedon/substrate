- Monthly partitioned events table (migration 010)
- Durable claims with TTL, attempt tracking, and auto-steal on expiry
- Workflow registry with content-hash idempotency
- Sync transition validators with 5s timeout and I/O safety AST check (FR-13)
- Async hook queue with dead-letter, retry, and out-of-process claim/complete/fail lifecycle
- Actor role enforcement (FR-24) with `register_actor_role` / `check_actor_role_authorized`
- Custom field validation at workflow registration and transition time (FR-27)
- Typed directed links between work items
- Cursor-based pagination on `query_work_items`
- JSONB containment (`@>`) filtering on custom fields with GIN index (BC-139)
- Replay with drift detection and continue-on-revoked flag (FR-25)
- `update_not_before` API for rescheduling work items (FR-26)

- Workflow composition via `extends:` with keyed list merge and `__append`/`__remove` modifiers (FR-29)
- Admin CLI: `workflow validate`, `work-item show/list`, `events show/tail`, `replay`, `schema init/status`, `hooks dead-letter list/requeue`, `actor-roles list`, `recurrence list/due/fire/cancel/update`
- HTTP sidecar (Plan 005): thin 1:1 pass-through of the Python API over FastAPI with bearer-token auth, sole-signer enforcement, hook claim/complete/fail lifecycle, and OpenAPI docs
- Dockerfile and README for sidecar deployment (`deploy/sidecar/`)
